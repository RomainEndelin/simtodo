[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is an amazing app, I really love using it! But I find all existing todo list workflow too complicated. You have to learn a lot of keywords to perform advanced features. But I don't need advanced features, I just want to be able to track my current tasks easily, without remembering all the fancy keywords. 
That's why I created SimTodo, a very simple way to manage todo list in Alfred. 

### Requirement
You need to have [Alfred Powerpack](https://buy.alfredapp.com/) to use this workflow.

### Download
You can download the latest version [here](https://raw.github.com/said-abidi/simtodo/master/bin/simtodo-latest.alfredworkflow)

### Usage

In order to list your tasks, you just have to open Alfred, and type the keyword "todo".

You want to add a new task? Easy, you open Alfred then you just have to type "todo" and the name of the task you want to save and press "enter".

Is it simple enough?

Ohh, and I guess you want to know how to mark a task as completed or even delete a task?
Well, just list your tasks with "todo", and then use the arrow to select the one that you are interested in, choose the option and click "enter".
